This initiative was established to enhance SUS functionalities for the city of Tubar√£o. These functionalities include vaccine application location, vaccination dates, and vaccination reports. The project was developed with both back-end and front-end components. Thymeleaf was employed for the front-end to facilitate data transfer to the user interface. In the back-end, we utilized Java with Spring Boot, incorporating a PostgreSQL database extension. If you're interested in supporting this project for our city, please feel free to contribute by forking!
